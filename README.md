# Data Visualization of Supervised Real Estate Across the US

I've always had a deep interest in real estate and aspire to purchase a property one day, so this dataset was very interesting to me :)

**Objective:**

Data visualization and dash-boarding was implemented on this dataset using **Tableau**.

**Questions we answered from our data visualization:**

Creating this Tableau dashboard allowed us to answer the following:
1. Compare/contrast the total parking spaces across the following parameters:
- Owned/leased
- Property type
- Quantity of onwned vs. leased in each property type
- Building status
- Building state

2. Which building states contained the most excess parking space?
(chornological order)
3. Visualize the decomissioned building cities with total parking.
4. Which type of property contained the most excess parking space?
5. Do leased or owned properties contain more active parking space?
6. Display which states contain the most leased/owned parking space.
7. Which property type contains the most active parking?
8. Analyze and compute the distribution of parking in each city by property type.
9. Compute another distrubution of parking spaces in relation to building status and building state.
10. Which building states contain zero parking spaces?
